Jape
===

Jape is a WordPress theme based on [underscores](https://github.com/automattic/_s).  It borrows a bit from other sites I've worked on. Useful stuff like including OpenGraph and breadcrumbs.

## Deploy

Not much to be done, really.  turn it on and go.  optionally activate GTM in inc/header-functions
